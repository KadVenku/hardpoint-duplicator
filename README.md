# YVaW Hardpoint Duplicator

This tool can be used to quickly duplicate hardpoints for Empire at War

## Usage

HardPoint code to be duplicated n times can be provided as seen in the screenshot. Numbering should be replaced by a pattern that will be replaced by the catual hardpoint number. (See the red rectangles in the screenshot.)
If the hardpoint to duplicate is a turret, you can (but don't have to) check the "Hardpoint is a turret" option and auto-create rotation arc variants. You will have to provide the hardpoint base name though. In this example the base name would be `BMIC`
